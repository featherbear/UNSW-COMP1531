'''
Write a program that, given the index, will calculate the n-th number in the 
Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as :

f(x) = 
	| x == 0     = 0
	| x == 1     = 1
	| otherwise  = f(x - 1) + f(x - 2)

The index is to be read from the standard input and the Fibonacci number at 
that index is to be printed to the standard output. You may assume that your
program will be tested with valid inputs only.
