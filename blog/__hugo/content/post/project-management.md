# Project Velocity
The duration of a project is broken up into intervals called _sprints_.  
The project velocity is the average rate of story points that are completed per sprint

Time - Number of user stories that can be implemented before a given date.
Number of iterations by velocity


Project duration - Total Story Points / Project Velocity

Scope - How long a set of stories will take to finish.  
_(Total Weeks of Estimated User Stores / Project Velocity)_
