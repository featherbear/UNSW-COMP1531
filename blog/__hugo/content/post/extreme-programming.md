# Project Velocity
The project velocity is the average rate of story points that are completed in each iteration

Time - Number of user stories that can be implemented before a given date.
Number of iterations by velocity


Project duration - Total Work Size / Project Velocity

Scope - How long a set of stories will take to finish.
Total Weeks of Estimated User Stores / Project Velocity
