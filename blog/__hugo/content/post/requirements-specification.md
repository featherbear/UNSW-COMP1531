# What is a requirement?
A requirement is **a condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem, or achieve an objective**. (IEEE)

_They describe the external behaviour (as opposed to a [Domain Model](../uml-domain-modelling), which describes the internal behaviour)_

Non-functional requirements are also quantifiable, and their they are assessed via metrics:

* Performance
* Reliability
* Usability
* Portability

# Stakeholders
Stakeholders are the parties who are involved in the development of the software

- End Users - The party who will utilise the requested functionality
- Customer - The party (business representative) who oversee the cost and timely delivery of the project's stages
- Design Team - The party involved in the implementation of the software

# Three C&apos;s of a User Story
**Card**  
The physical representation (post-it note!) summarising who, what and why  

**Conversation**  
The dialogue between parties, specifying concrete feature requests and requirements  

**Confirmation**  
The acknowledgement of the procured requirements and tasks
