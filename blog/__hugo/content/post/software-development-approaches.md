# Waterfall Approach
A very formal approach, where phases of the SDLC are carried out in a sequential manner 

Each phase completed before progressing to the next one

Good for software with very clearly known and explicit requirements without and ambiguitiy

(can't go back - or will be very costly)
rigid
no working software produced until late into the SDLC


Very stable


# Iterative / Incremental Approach
- Incremental functionality


Break the problem into smaller pieces and prioritise them
Incremental + customer feedback

## Models
- Unified Software Development Process
  - Requirements, analysis, design, implementation of each approach
  - Timeboxed
- Rational Unified Process
- Agile



// Agile can be more error prone to the waterfall model, which is risk free
