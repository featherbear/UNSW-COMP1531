# Analysis
aka **'Problem domain'** - Understanding the Problem  

* What is the current issue
* What does the customer need
* Functional requirements (inputs, outputs)
* Non functional requirements (performance, security, quality, maintainability, extensibility)

&nbsp;

- [Requirements Specification](../requirements-specification)
- [User Stories](../user-stories)
- [Use Case Modelling](../uml-use-case-modelling)

Collect this information via use-case modelling, user stories

# Design
* Developing the implementation of the requirements
* Plan out the system's internal structure that delivers the external behaviour
* Software blueprints (design artifacts, domain models)

&nbsp;

Component Design

# Implementation
Writing the software

# Testing

Unit testing (component testing)
(Regression test)
Integration test
User acceptance test (Verifying that the implementation meets the requirements)

# Evaluation
* aka Release & Maintenance
* Deployment
* Regular testing
* Addition of features
