# Domain Model

Also referred to as a **conceptual model** or **domain object model**  
Provides a visual representation of the problem domain, by breaking it into real world objects and identifying the relationships between these objects

Determines the internal behaviour (whitebox), compared to the external behaviour detailing through a [requirements analysis](../requirements-specification)

# CRC Cards
aka _Class, Responsibility, Collaboration_ Cards  

CRC Cards are a tool of the [OO design paradigm](../object-oriented-design) which help to represent a domain object.  

**Class** - the name of the class  
**Responsibility** - What the class knows, and does  
**Collaboration** - Relationship to other classes
