**User stories** are development artifacts which provide feature requirements that the software has to conform to.  
**Epic stories** are a summary of all of the user stories of a specific role.  
Each user story has several **acceptance criteria** _(criterion)_ which are specific requirements for that user story

# Example
* Some epic story
    * Some user story (5 points)
        * An acceptance criteria
        * Another acceptance criteria
        * Yet another acceptance criteria
    * Some other user story (3 points)
        * Oh look, it's an acceptance criteria
        * More acceptance criteria!
* A second epic story
    * Some user story (2 points)
        * An acceptance criteria
        * Another acceptance criteria
        * Yet another acceptance criteria
    * Some other user story (1 point)
        * Oh look, it's an acceptance criteria
        * More acceptance criteria!


# The RGB Framework
**R**ole  
**G**oal  
**B**enefit  

The RGB framework is a method of expressing user stories in the format of:  
*As a _______ I want to ______ so that _________*

## Examples
- As a <i><u>librarian</u></i>, I want to have the <i><u>facility of searching a book by different criteria</u></i> so that <i><u>I will save time to serve a customer</u></i>. 

- As a <i><u>student</u></i>, I want to <i><u>be reminded of my class schedule</u></i> every morning, so that <i><u>I will be on time</u></i>  

- As a <i><u>lawyer</u></i>, I want to <i><u>see all my active cases on the main screen</u></i>, so that <i><u>I know what to do for the day</u></i>  

# User Story Points
_(arbitrary)_ priority values (known as _points_) are assigned to each user story, which indicates the priority and time required for that user story to be met.

The time allocated for each point is arbitrary, and is defined by the user.

# Epic Stories
An Epic Story covers the high-level features for a role  
For particularly high-level stories, Epic stories **do not** need to follow the RGB framework
 
i.e As a <i><u>librarian</u></i> I want to <i><u>manage all the books in the library</u></i>

# Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criterion are individual requirements and functionality for each user story

*When ____, then _____*

# Using the Invest Framework
[**I** ndependent](#independent)  
[**N** egotiable](#negotiable)  
[**V** aluable](#valuable)  
[**E** timatable](#estimatable)  
[**S** mall](#small)  
[**T** estable](#testable)  


## Independent
Each user story should not need to rely on other user stories

## Negotiable
Leave room for more details  
"Breadth first, depth later"

## Valuable
Delivers value to the _customer_ ***and*** _end user_  
(value of the user story)

## Estimatable
Story needs to be clear enough to estimate the needed time

## Small
Each user story should be small, and deliverable within time

## Testable
Clear acceptance criteria
